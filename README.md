# river-frog-simulations
River Frog automates material selection and structural validation for a flood-resistant trash interceptor using Python. It extracts and processes alloy data, runs CFD and structural simulations (ANSYS), and integrates DeepGraph for material analysis. SolidWorks models guide simulations, ensuring resilience against real-world flood conditions.
